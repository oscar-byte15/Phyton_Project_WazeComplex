# Project with Python ðŸš€
In this project, python was used to create an application with a graphical interface where the shortest path from one point to another in km can be found.
For this, information from .txt files has been used that represent the latitude, longitude and priority of the traffic.
Djkstra's algorithm has also been used to find the shortest path.

I would like to give credit to Gonzalo Barrazueta Vilcachagua for helping me get the job done.

Thank you,

Oscar de la Cruz.
